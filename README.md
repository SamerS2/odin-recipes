# odin-recipe
# This is one of my first projects working with html and building upon my skills and knowledge of the basics. I created a main page with an unordered list of random recipes which hyperlinks to pages about each of those recipes. Using images for each recipe and lists showcasing ingredients and steps to making each food recipe.
